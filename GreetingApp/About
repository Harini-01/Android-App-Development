This is the first app that I have created.

Overview
GreetingsApp is an Android application designed to welcome users by their name. The app consists of a single activity where users can input their name, and upon clicking a button, they receive a personalized greeting displayed via a Toast message.

Key Components

The main activity of the app where the user interaction occurs.
It includes an EditText for user input, a Button to trigger the greeting, and a TextView to display the title.

activity_main.xml:
